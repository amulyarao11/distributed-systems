# Description

Distributed systems are a powerful tool that enables scaling storage and computation power at relatively cheap costs. However, distribution brings in many complexities unseen in single computer systems. In this course, students will learn various such complexities and current solutions, both from industry and academia. This course requires reading 1 or 2 papers per week, four lab projects, and an (optional) final project. Each class will have a mix of lecture and discussion.


Students will learn

- How large-scale systems are structured

- Different replication techniques and their tradeoffs

- How to build a fault-tolerant systems

- Data consistency challenges and a few remedies

- How to speed up big data processing with data parallelism

- Emerging distributed programming model and framework

- How distributed systems may improve energy and cost efficiency
